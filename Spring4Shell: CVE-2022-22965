In late March 2022, two remote command execution vulnerabilities in the Java Spring framework were made public. 
The first of these vulnerabilities affects a component of the framework called "Spring Cloud Functions". 
The second, arguably more serious vulnerability, affects a component in  "Spring Core" —  the heart of the framework — thus significantly 
increasing the vulnerability's potential impact and earning it the name "Spring4Shell" (a play on Log4Shell, the name of a brutal vulnerability 
disclosed at the end of 2021).

To understand Spring4Shell, it is important that we understand CVE-2010-1622. Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is part of the Spring Framework which 
makes it easy to develop web applications following the MVC design pattern. One of the features of Spring MVC is that it automatically 
instantiates and populates an object of a specified class when a request is made based on the parameters sent to the endpoint. 
In simple terms, this could be abused to overwrite important attributes of the parent class, resulting in remote code execution.

Current conditions for vulnerability (as stated in Spring's announcement of the vulnerability) can be summarised as follows:

1. JDK 9+
2. A vulnerable version of the Spring Framework (<5.2 | 5.2.0-19 | 5.3.0-17)
2. Apache Tomcat as a server for the Spring application, packaged as a WAR
3. A dependency on the spring-webmvc and/or spring-webflux components of the Spring Framework
