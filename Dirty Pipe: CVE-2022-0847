In March 2022, a researcher named Max Kellerman publicly disclosed a Linux Kernel vulnerability (nicknamed "Dirty Pipe" for its similarities to the 
notorious "Dirty Cow" exploit affecting older versions of the kernel) that allowed attackers to arbitrarily overwrite files on the operating system.
The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed in early 2022 and was publicly released in a blog post written by Max Kellerman soon after patches were
made available.
